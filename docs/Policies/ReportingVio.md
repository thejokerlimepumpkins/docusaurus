# Reporting a Rule Violation
## In-Game Reporting

If you witness a rule violation during gameplay, your first step should be to report it to online staff. Here's how to do it:

1. Use the /ids command to activate overhead player IDs.
1. Identify the player you wish to report and note their ID.
1. Use the /report command, which will open a form asking for the player ID.
1. Enter the player’s ID and provide a brief description of the rule violation.
1. Click Submit.
1. Disengage from the situation and continue your roleplay.

It’s important to avoid getting involved with players breaking the rules. Simply report the incident and carry on with your roleplay. The staff team will review the situation, and if you're found to be participating in the violation, you could also be held accountable.

Please note, staff may not follow up directly with you, but rest assured that all reports are thoroughly reviewed.

## Submitting a Ticket

If you have additional evidence or details to provide, the best way to report a player is through a ticket on Discord:

    Go to the #hydrate-support channel in Discord.
    Select the "Player Report" category.
    Provide details of the rule violation, including any relevant context.
    Attach any evidence you have. Video (with audio) is preferred.
    Wait for a staff member to review your ticket.

Keep in mind, staff need clear evidence to take action. Simply stating that a player broke a rule is not enough. We follow this policy to avoid "he said, she said" situations. Remember, you wouldn’t want to be punished without evidence, and neither would others.

We appreciate all player reports, as they help improve the server. However, to maintain confidentiality, staff will not disclose the outcome of any reports or punishments issued.
